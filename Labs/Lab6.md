# Node.js and Pystache
## Part A
I ran the following commands so I can use the Pystache.
```
$ pip install pystache
```
I checked my node.js istallation using these commands.
```
$ node -v
$ npm -v
$ node -h
```
I then ran the following commands and opened up my server links for both of them they both outputed the same message of Hello World!
```
$ node hello-world.js
$ node hello.js
```
For the second command every time I refreshed my link on Google Chrome, the temrinal would output this message
```
response end call done
request end event fired
```
Next I ran this command which counts everytime the server was refreshed and outputs that number on the webpage and terminal you can see this happening in the images below.
```
$ node http.js
```
